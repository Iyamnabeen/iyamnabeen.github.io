So basically, Actually i don't know what to write & what should i share because 
it's my very first blog on my website, But Alright let's start from the beginning
let's talk about myself. so, I'm Nabeen Tiwaree. I was born and raised in syangja
but currently living in kathmandu with my baba & mummy. I like coding in c & go,
i actually like learning spanish in free time, not because of my foreign plans but
for fun xD.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

I'm heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">Dylanaraps</a> & <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps?tab=repositories">his projects</a> are spectacular <a href="https://kisslinux.org">KissLinux</a> 
is the only one that made me realize the true meaning of being less bloated.
It differs from person to person,like how they define bloatware but for me... 
            ~ 'a peace of software taking space for no reason is bloatware'


I don't like playing games neither physical nor virtual instead i spend time 
on reading <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/">GNU MANUALS.</a> My baba own a shop so i spend my most of the time 
seating at shop at that time i read source code of gnu utils but from
<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">bsd forums</a> xD.
